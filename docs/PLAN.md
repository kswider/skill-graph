# Skill Navigator: plan

Living document: update it when a decision changes. Milestone status is tracked in the table in §8.

## Context

An internal platform that shows an organisation's competencies as a graph of **roles → technical skills, soft skills and certifications**:

- Employees keep a profile and plan their development towards a target role.
- Career Advisors follow their team, suggest development steps and send feedback on roles and paths.
- Practice Leads own the roles and development paths of their practice.
- A Site Lead oversees the practices of the site.

Decisions made at the start: hosting on **Vercel**, **Neon Postgres + Drizzle**, **Cytoscape.js** for the graph, and every change through a **feature branch → PR → auto-merge when CI passes**.

**Organisation model (decided after M1, refined twice):**

- One **site** per installation, led by a **Site Lead**. The Site Lead replaces the "admin" and oversees several practices. The database is ready for more sites later.
- **Practices** are focused departments, e.g. Frontend Practice or Delivery Management. Each has one or more **Practice Leads** who control it: its roles, specialisations, requirements and development paths.
- A role has a **core** set of requirements and optional **specialisations** that add their own, e.g. Frontend Developer: React / Angular, or Scrum Master: SAFe / Management 3.0. Each role page also suggests **similar roles** with an overlapping skillset, e.g. Scrum Master ↔ Project Manager.
- **Career Advisors** (called "managers" in the code and the data: `manager_id`, `isManager`) work within a practice. They see their direct reports' profiles, **recommend** development steps to them, and send the Practice Lead **change requests**: feedback on roles and paths, and proposals for new roles or specialisations.
- **Who sees named profiles**: the person, their Career Advisor, and the Practice Leads of the person's practice. The Site Lead sees aggregates only.
- **Catalogue**: three item types: **technical skills** (including tools and platforms), **soft skills** and **certifications**.
- **Weights only**: a role requires an item as Critical, Important or Nice to have. There are **no proficiency levels**: a person has a skill or doesn't.
- **Profiles**: explicit and self-declared. Certifications carry the date obtained and the expiry date. An expired certification isn't a gap: it's shown faded and marked as expired, so it's visible that the person once earned it. Nobody confirms profiles in the MVP.
- **Seniority**: no seniority levels inside a role; a senior role is a separate role, linked by a path.

### The brief, in short

- **Problem:** answers to "how do I move from role A to role B?", "which skills are essential and which optional?", "what other paths exist?" are spread across job profiles, community leads, managers and learning platforms.
- **Node types:** Role, Skill, Technology/Tool. **Priorities:** Critical (must-have), Important, Nice to have; colours red / orange / green. Line thickness = strength of the dependency.
- **Scenario 1:** a Frontend Developer (JavaScript, TypeScript, React) wants to be a Data Engineer. Shared: Problem Solving, Git, Agile. Missing: SQL, Python, Data Modelling, Spark, Databricks.
- **Scenario 2:** a Project Manager wants to be a Delivery Manager. Missing: Financial Management, Account Management, Commercial Awareness, Leadership, People Management.
- **Scenario 3:** a manager opens an employee's profile and sees current competencies, possible paths and the roles reachable with current skills.
- **MVP:** role browser, interactive competency map, comparing two roles, graph editing.
- **Roadmap:** V1 a hand-maintained graph; V2 imports from the Skills Framework, HR systems and learning platforms; V3 an AI assistant ("I want to become an AI Engineer").

## 1. Concepts

### Structure

```text
Site                                    Site Lead
 └─ Practice, e.g. Frontend Practice    Practice Lead(s)
     ├─ Roles: Frontend Developer, UX Developer, …
     │   └─ Specialisations: React, Angular
     └─ People: managers and their direct reports (members of the practice)
```

Another example: in Delivery Management, a manager has a Business Analyst, a Project Manager and a Scrum Master reporting to them.

### Glossary

- **Site**: the organisational unit an installation serves. There's one in the MVP, led by one or more **Site Leads**.
- **Practice**: a department of related roles, e.g. Frontend Practice, Delivery Management, Data & AI.
  - It has one or more **Practice Leads**, and its **members** are the people whose home practice it is.
  - Practice Leads control the practice: its roles, their specialisations, requirements and development paths.
- **Role** (job role): a named position in a practice, e.g. Scrum Master. A role has:
  - **a description**: what the role does and the skillset it looks for, written by the Practice Lead
  - **its practice**
  - **core requirements**: the technical skills, soft skills and certifications everyone in the role needs, each weighted Critical, Important or Nice to have
  - **optional specialisations**: directions within the role, each adding its own requirements (below)
  - **paths**: official career moves to other roles (below)
  - **similar roles**: suggestions of roles with an overlapping skillset, showing where they share requirements, e.g. Scrum Master ↔ Project Manager (below)

  Not to be confused with what someone may do in the app: that's their **user type** (below).

- **Specialisation**: a direction within a role that adds requirements on top of the role's core.
  - Examples:
    - **Scrum Master: SAFe** (scaled agile): SAFe and PI Planning, plus the SAFe Scrum Master certification
    - **Scrum Master: Facilitation / Management 3.0**: facilitation techniques and Management 3.0 practices, plus the Management 3.0 Foundation certification
    - **Frontend Developer: React** or **: Angular**
  - Its **effective requirements** = the role's core plus the specialisation's own. Where both name the same item, the specialisation's weight applies.
  - A specialisation is also a **path within the role**: from the core, what's missing is exactly the specialisation's own requirements. No separate path needs to be defined for it.
  - A role may have no specialisations.
- **Similar roles**: computed from requirements, not curated. Two roles are similar when their core requirements overlap, weighted by importance (§4). The role page lists the most similar roles with:
  - the share they have in common
  - the shared items, the synergies, e.g. Scrum Master and Project Manager share Agile, Facilitation, Stakeholder Management and Communication
  - what each adds

  Similar roles describe the roles themselves; suggested paths (below) describe a person.

- **Catalogue item**: one entry in the catalogue shared by the whole site. There is one "Python", not one per practice. Three types:
  - **Technical skill**: languages, frameworks, methods, tools and platforms. Examples: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, SQL, Data Modelling, Azure, Databricks, Git. Tools and platforms have the category "Tool / platform", so they can be filtered and shown apart.
  - **Soft skill**: how someone works with people and problems. Examples: Solutioning, Team Leading, Mentoring, Leadership, Communication, Stakeholder Management.
  - **Certification**: a credential with an issuer. Examples: Figma Foundation, Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I), Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900).
- **Requirement**: a role or specialisation needs a catalogue item, with
  - a **weight (priority)**: Critical, Important or Nice to have
  - an optional **note** explaining why it matters

  The weight belongs to the requirement, not the item: SQL can be Critical for a Data Engineer and Nice to have for a Full-stack Developer. Certifications are weighted the same way, e.g. PSM I is Critical for a Scrum Master. **There are no proficiency levels**: a person has a skill or doesn't, and holds a valid certification or doesn't.

- **Certification status** in a profile:
  - **valid**
  - **expiring**: within 90 days; flagged
  - **expired**: past its expiry date. It is **not** a gap and still counts as held. The UI shows it faded (semi-transparent) with "expired on <date>", so it's clear the person once earned it and may want to renew it.
- **Dependency**: "Databricks builds on Python and Spark". It orders learning in a plan. Items can also be **related** ("Terraform ↔ Bicep": alternatives or companions).
- **Path**: a career move from one role (or specialisation) to another, of two kinds:
  - **Official path**: defined by a Practice Lead, with a description and a typical duration. A role can have several official paths out, e.g. Data Engineer → AI Engineer or → Solution Architect, or Frontend Developer: React → Frontend Developer: Angular.
  - **Specialisation path**: from a role's core into one of its specialisations (above). It always exists, so nobody has to define it.
  - **Suggested path**: computed, not curated. These are roles the person is already close to by readiness. The UI labels them as suggestions.

  A path never copies requirements: what's missing is always the target's **current** effective requirements compared with the person's profile.

- **Profile**: a person's
  - home practice
  - current role and specialisation
  - the technical and soft skills they have
  - the certifications they hold, each with the date obtained and the expiry date (if it expires)
  - optionally a **target** role and specialisation

  It's explicit: when someone picks their current role, the app offers to pre-fill the profile with the role's effective skill requirements, and they untick what they don't have. Certifications aren't pre-filled, because they need dates. There's no hidden inheritance. The employee declares it, and nobody confirms it in the MVP.

- **Recommendation**: a manager's development suggestion to a direct report, with a comment. It can be:
  - a target role or specialisation
  - a skill or certification to work on

  The employee sees it in their plan and accepts or declines it. An accepted target becomes their target, and accepted items appear in their plan marked as recommended.

- **Change request**: a manager's message to a practice's Practice Leads, with a reason. It can be:
  - **feedback on a role or path**: add, remove or re-weight a requirement; add or remove a path; change a description
  - **a proposal for a new role or specialisation**

  A request is open, needs info, approved, rejected or withdrawn, and either side can comment. Approving one applies its changes in one transaction. For a proposal, approving creates the role or specialisation as a draft for the Practice Lead to complete. Every applied change goes to the audit log, linked to the request.

- **User type** is derived from data, not a single setting, so one person can be several at once:
  - everyone is an **Employee**
  - you're a **Career Advisor** if someone reports to you
  - you're a **Practice Lead** if you're assigned to a practice
  - you're a **Site Lead** if you're assigned to the site
  - you're **Basic** if the Site Lead limited you to Explore Skills. Basic stands alone: it can't be set on a Site Lead, a Practice Lead or a Career Advisor, and none of those can be given to a Basic person. A Basic person has no profile, plan, recommendations or change requests: they see Home, Roles, Catalogue, Graph and Compare, and every other page is a 404.

### Functions by user type

**Employee** (everyone)

- Creates a profile:
  - picks their current role and specialisation
  - gets a pre-filled profile and corrects it
  - ticks the technical and soft skills they have
  - adds certifications with the date obtained and the expiry date
- Sees how they meet **their own role**: met and missing, plus certifications that are expiring or expired.
- Browses roles, the catalogue and the graph. A role page shows its description, core requirements and specialisations (by type and weight), its paths and similar roles with their synergies.
- **Compares two roles against their own profile** (§4): what they already have and what's missing, by priority and type.
- Picks a target and gets a **development plan**: the gaps in learning order, with their manager's accepted recommendations marked. Progress updates as they update their profile.
- Sees and answers **recommendations** from their manager.
- Sees the official paths from their role and the suggested ones.
- Sees only their own profile.

**Career Advisor** (anyone with direct reports; works within a practice)

- Everything an employee can do.
- **Team view**: each direct report with their role, target, readiness and top gaps. Plus aggregated gaps, e.g. "3 of 5 people lack Critical SQL for their role".
- **Employee profile** (Scenario 3):
  - their profile, met and missing for their role, and certifications that are expiring or expired
  - official and suggested paths
  - the roles they can reach, with readiness
- **Recommends** development steps to a direct report: a target or items to develop, with a comment.
- **Succession**: who in the team is closest to a given role.
- **Change requests** to the Practice Leads: feedback on roles and paths, proposals for new roles or specialisations. Follows their status and comments.

**Practice Lead** (assigned to a practice)

- Everything an employee can do.
- **Controls the practice**:
  - creates and edits its roles (description, core requirements) and their specialisations
  - sets requirements (item, weight, note)
  - defines official paths
- **Reviews change requests** for the practice: approve (applies or creates a draft), reject with a reason, or ask for more information.
- Sees the **named profiles of the practice's members**, and the practice's gaps and readiness per role.
- Adds items to the shared catalogue. Duplicates are blocked by normalised name.
- Can also send change requests to other practices.

**Site Lead** (assigned to the site; replaces the admin)

- Everything an employee can do.
- **Practices**: creates them and appoints their Practice Leads.
- **People**: home practice, who reports to whom, who leads what. Later, these come from the HR system (V2).
- **Site overview**, aggregated only, with groups smaller than 5 people hidden:
  - gaps and readiness per practice and per role
  - bench strength: how many people are close to each role
- **Catalogue**: merges duplicates and maintains categories.
- **Audit log**. Can edit any role in an emergency; the audit log records it.
- **Doesn't** see named skill profiles.

Every capability is checked on the server by one `can(user, action, resource)` helper, with an end-to-end test for each denial.

**Basic** is not a column of this table: a Basic person may only browse roles, the catalogue and the graph and compare roles (the Explore Skills pages), and nothing else in the table. The Site Lead sets and lifts it on `/site/people`; the audit log records it.

**Why relational and not a graph database:** the data is small. All graph algorithms run in TypeScript on a cached, in-memory copy of the graph, and Postgres stays a plain store with constraints. A graph database would add operational cost for no gain, and Postgres moves easily to Azure Database for PostgreSQL later.

## 3. Data model (Drizzle, `src/db/schema.ts`)

M1 built v1. Migration `0001` (milestone M2) brings it to the model below; there's no production user data yet, so that's cheap. _(new)_ marks additions to v1.

- **`sites`** _(new)_: `id`, `name`, `slug`, timestamps. One row in the MVP.
- **`site_leads`** _(new)_: (`site_id`, `user_id`) PK.
- **`practices`** _(new)_: `id`, `site_id` → sites, `name` unique per site, `slug` unique, `description`, timestamps.
- **`practice_leads`** _(new)_: (`practice_id`, `user_id`) PK. A practice can have several leads, and a person can lead several practices.
- **`basic_users`**: (`user_id`) PK. People the Site Lead limited to Explore Skills.
- **`nodes`**: roles, specialisations and catalogue items.
  - `id`, `type` enum(`role`, `specialization`, `technical_skill`, `soft_skill`, `certification`) _(new: replaces `skill` and `technology`)_, `name`, `slug` unique, `normalized_name`, `description`, `category`, `tags`, `external_id`, `source`, timestamps.
  - `practice_id` → practices _(new)_: required for roles, empty otherwise.
  - `parent_role_id` → nodes _(new)_: required for specialisations (their role), empty otherwise.
  - `issuer` _(new)_: for certifications (e.g. Scrum.org, Microsoft, Figma), empty otherwise.
  - `status` enum(`draft`, `published`) _(new)_: drafts come from approved proposals and are visible only to Practice Leads until published.
  - Name rules:
    - Normalisation: lowercase, punctuation stripped except `+` and `#`, `&` read as "and".
    - Names are unique across roles and catalogue items.
    - Specialisation names are unique within their role ("React" can be a specialisation of Frontend Developer and also a technical skill). Their slug is scoped to the role: `frontend-developer--react`.
- **`edges`**
  - `id`, `kind`, `source_id`/`target_id` → nodes (on delete cascade), `priority`, `strength` 1–5, `note` _(new)_, `typical_months` _(new)_, `external_id`, `source`, timestamps.
  - Kinds (type rules in the domain validator, tested):
    - `requires`: role or specialisation → technical skill / soft skill / certification, with a **priority** (weight)
    - `builds_on`: item → item it builds on (a prerequisite). Cycles are warned about.
    - `related_to`: item ↔ item, undirected, stored with `source_id < target_id`
    - `next_step`: role/specialisation → role/specialisation, an **official path**, with an optional description (`note`) and `typical_months`
  - Database checks: no self-loops; `priority` set exactly on `requires`; strength 1–5; `related_to` ordered; `typical_months` only on `next_step`.
- **Better Auth tables**: `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification` (M5, migration `0002`).
- **`profiles`**
  - `user_id` PK, `practice_id` → practices _(new: home practice)_, `current_role_id` and `current_specialization_id` → nodes, `target_role_id` and `target_specialization_id` _(new)_ → nodes, `manager_id` → user, `theme` _(M7+, migration `0003`)_: the colour theme the person chose, empty until then, timestamps.
  - `app_role` is removed. Manager, Practice Lead and Site Lead follow from `manager_id`, `practice_leads` and `site_leads`.
- **`profile_items`** _(replaces `profile_skills`)_: (`user_id`, `node_id`) PK, `obtained_on` and `expires_on` dates (certifications only; `expires_on` empty if it doesn't expire), timestamps.
- **`recommendations`** _(new)_
  - `id`, `person_id` → user, `author_id` → user, `node_id` → nodes (a role/specialisation = a suggested target; a catalogue item = something to work on), `comment`, `status` enum(`open`, `accepted`, `declined`), timestamps, `answered_at`.
  - Index (`person_id`, `status`).
- **`change_requests`** _(new)_
  - `id`, `practice_id` → practices (whose leads review it), `role_id` → nodes (empty for a new-role proposal), `author_id` → user, `status` enum(`open`, `needs_info`, `approved`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`), `reason`, `changes` jsonb, `decided_by`, `decided_at`, `decision_note`, timestamps.
  - `changes` is a list of operations validated with zod:
    - `add_requirement` (an existing item, or a new item to create) with a weight and a note
    - `update_requirement`, `remove_requirement`
    - `add_path` / `remove_path`, `update_description`
    - `propose_role`, `propose_specialization`
  - Indexes: (`practice_id`, `status`), (`author_id`).
- **`change_request_comments`** _(new)_: `id`, `request_id` → change_requests (cascade), `author_id`, `body`, `at`.
- **`audit_log`**
  - `id`, `actor_id`, `action`, `entity`, `entity_id`, `before`, `after`, `at`.
  - `entity` gains `site`, `practice`, `profile_item`, `recommendation`, `change_request` and `access`.
  - New `change_request_id`: set when a change was applied by approving a request.
  - Written in the same transaction as the change.

## 4. Domain logic (`src/domain/`, written test-first)

A requirement is **met** when the person has the skill or holds the certification, **including an expired one**. Otherwise it's **missing**. Met certifications also carry their status: **expiring** (within 90 days) or **expired**. Expired ones count as met for gaps and readiness; the UI shows them faded with their expiry date.

The functions:

- **Effective requirements** `requirementsOf(role, specialisation?)`: the role's core plus the specialisation's own; for the same item, the specialisation wins.
- **Fit to a target** `assess(profile, target, today)` returns `met` (certifications with their status: valid, expiring or expired) and `missing`, grouped by weight and type. Used for "how do I meet my own role", for gap analysis and for the plan.
- **Learning order** within `missing`, applied in this order:
  1. Critical before Important before Nice
  2. within a priority, prerequisites first (topological sort over `builds_on`)
  3. then items more roles require first
  4. then by name

  This gives Scenario 1's order: SQL, Python, Data Modelling, then Spark before Databricks.

- **Compare two targets with a profile** `compare(a, b, profile?)` returns:
  - `shared`: in both, with both weights
  - `onlyB`: what moving to B adds
  - `onlyA`: what B doesn't need

  With a profile, every row in `shared` and `onlyB` also says whether the person already has it or still has to learn it.

- **Readiness** `readiness(profile, target)` = Σ w(met) / Σ w(all requirements).
  - Weights: Critical 3, Important 2, Nice 1.
  - **Reachable**: every Critical requirement met and readiness ≥ 0.70.
  - **Stretch**: readiness ≥ 0.50. **Far**: anything lower.
  - The thresholds live in `src/domain/config.ts`.
- **Similar roles** `similarRoles(role, n)`: weighted overlap of core requirements.
  - For two roles A and B, each item gets a weight per role (Critical 3, Important 2, Nice 1; 0 if the role doesn't require it).
  - similarity = Σ min(wA, wB) / Σ max(wA, wB) over all items either role requires (a weighted Jaccard index, 0–1).
  - Returns the top N roles above a threshold (0.25, in `src/domain/config.ts`), each with its shared items and what it adds. The role's own specialisations are left out.
- **Paths for a person**:
  - Official paths from their current role and specialisation, up to 3 hops, each with readiness.
  - Specialisation paths within their current role, each with readiness.
  - Suggested: the top N targets by readiness that no official path leads to, labelled as suggestions.
- **Development plan**: `assess(profile, target)` in learning order, with accepted recommendations marked (and added if the target doesn't require them), plus progress = readiness.
- **Aggregates**:
  - Team (manager): per item, how many reports have it as a Critical/Important gap for their current or target role.
  - Practice (Practice Lead): the same per role, named.
  - Site (Site Lead): the same per practice and role, hiding groups under 5 people, plus bench strength (people reachable / stretch per role).
- **Change requests**:
  - `validateChanges(graph, request)` re-checks every operation against the current graph: items exist, no duplicates, type rules hold, no cycles.
  - `applyChanges` turns a valid request into graph writes, or into a draft role or specialisation. Approval fails with a clear message if an operation no longer applies.
- **Validators** for every write:
  - no duplicate normalised names; specialisations unique within their role
  - no self-loops; type rules per kind; issuer only on certifications
  - roles have a practice; specialisations have a role
  - `builds_on` cycle detection (warn, then confirm)
  - a count of everything a destructive change affects

## 5. Routes and API

**Pages**

- `/` home: my role and how I meet it, my target and progress, my paths, new recommendations.
- `/onboarding`: pick my practice, role and specialisation, then review the pre-filled profile.
- `/me`: profile editor (skills, certifications with dates, target). `/me/plan`: development plan and recommendations.
- `/roles`, `/roles/[slug]`:
  - description
  - core requirements, grouped by type (technical / soft / certifications) and weight, with notes
  - specialisations, each with what it adds
  - practice and Practice Leads
  - official paths in and out
  - similar roles with their synergies (shared items) and a link to compare
  - "compare with my profile"
- `/catalogue`, `/catalogue/[slug]`: (filters are links with the state in the URL, searchable, no JavaScript needed) technical skills, soft skills and certifications, and which roles need each one (with weight).
- `/compare?a=&b=`: two roles or specialisations, always with my profile overlaid.
- `/explore`: the graph (§6).
- Manager:
  - `/team`
  - `/team/[userId]` (Scenario 3, plus "recommend")
  - `/team/succession?role=`
- Practice Lead:
  - `/practices/[slug]`: roles, members, gaps, request inbox
  - `/practices/[slug]/roles/[role]/edit` (core, specialisations, paths, drafts)
  - `/practices/[slug]/people/[userId]`
- Change requests: `/requests` (mine and my inbox), `/requests/new?practice=&role=`, `/requests/[id]` (changes, reason, comments, decision).
- Site Lead:
  - `/site`: overview and bench strength
  - `/site/practices`, `/site/people`, `/site/catalogue`, `/site/audit`

**API** (`/api/v1`, a thin layer over `src/domain`, built for V3)

- `GET /graph`
- `GET /roles/:slug`
- `GET /compare?a=&b=`
- `GET /me/assessment?target=`
- `GET /people/:id/paths` (only for those who may see that person's profile)

All writes go through Server Actions with zod validation and `can()`. The graph read is cached with a cache tag that edits and approved requests invalidate.

**How edits work (M9).** Every change to roles, specialisations, requirements, paths and catalogue items goes through `src/db/graph-write.ts`: it checks the permission (`canEditNode`, `can()`), re-checks the rules against the current graph, writes, and appends an `audit_log` row in the same transaction, so a refused change leaves nothing behind. A Site Lead editing a practice they don't lead is allowed and recorded with `emergency: true`. New roles and specialisations are drafts (only Practice Leads see them) until published; a role needs a requirement to be published. After a write the `graph` cache tag is expired (`updateTag`), so the change shows at once. Approved change requests (M10) will apply their operations through the same functions, with `changeRequestId` set.

**How change requests work (M10).** A manager or Practice Lead sends one to a practice (`/requests/new`): feedback on a role or specialisation, or a proposal for a new role or specialisation, as a list of operations plus a reason. The practice's Practice Leads (and the Site Lead, in an emergency) see it in their inbox and **approve** it, **ask for information** (the author answers in the thread, which reopens it), or **reject** it with a reason; the author can **withdraw** it. Approving re-checks every operation against the role as it is now and applies them all in one transaction through the editor's write functions (`src/db/change-requests.ts`), so the audit rows carry the request's id; if one no longer applies, nothing changes and the reviewer is told which. A proposal becomes a **draft** for the lead to complete. Only the author, the practice's leads and the Site Lead can see a request.

**How people views work (M11).** `/team` lists a manager's direct reports with their role, target, how well they meet their role, what they still need and certifications to watch, plus the gaps the team shares ("2 of 5 people lack Testing"); `/team/[userId]` is a report's named profile (Scenario 3: fit to their role, target and plan, official and suggested paths, the roles they could reach now, recommendations, and a form to recommend a role to aim for or a skill to work on); `/team/succession` ranks the team by how close each person is to a role. Practice Leads get the same for their practice's members (`/practices/[slug]`, `/practices/[slug]/people/[userId]`, `/practices/[slug]/succession`) plus the gaps and the average fit per role. **Privacy (Scenario 10)**: a named profile opens only if `can(actor, "profile:view", person)` (the person, their manager, the Practice Leads of their practice); anyone else, including the Site Lead, gets a 404, and the Site Lead's practice page shows no names (aggregates come with M12).

**How the Site Lead works (M12).** `/site` is the overview, numbers only: per practice and per role, how well people meet their role on average, how many still miss a Critical requirement and what is missed most, plus bench strength (how many people could take on a role now, or are a stretch away). **Groups of fewer than 5 people are hidden, and so are small counts inside a shown group** ("Accessibility: fewer than 5 people"), because "1 person lacks X" in a team of seven points at someone; nothing in the result carries a person's id or name (tested). `/site/practices` creates practices (with their first Practice Lead) and appoints or removes leads (a practice always keeps at least one); `/site/people` sets home practice and reporting lines (no loops, no skills shown) and appoints Site Leads (the site keeps at least one); `/site/catalogue` merges duplicate items (the impact first, then a confirmation: requirements move, a role that had both keeps the stronger weight, holders and recommendations follow, the duplicate is deleted) and keeps categories; `/site/audit` is the audit log, filterable and paged. Every change is audited with a plain sentence.

## 6. Graph UX (solving the problems the brief doesn't cover)

- **Never the whole hairball by default.** `/explore` opens on a search box and role picker.
  - The overview uses the fcose layout, faint links and labels only when zoomed in. If the performance test (M8) needs it, it switches to the WebGL renderer.
  - **Focus mode**: the selected node plus N hops (1–3).
  - For a role, the **concentric layout** puts the role in the centre with rings for Critical (inner), Important and Nice. Its specialisations sit next to it, and selecting one adds its requirements.
  - **My view**: with my profile overlaid, a focused role's requirements show met / missing.
- **Type shown by shape**, each in a neutral per-type tint:
  - role = hexagon
  - specialisation = small hexagon attached to its role
  - technical skill = ellipse (tools and platforms with a darker outline)
  - soft skill = diamond
  - certification = star; in my view, an expired certification I hold is drawn semi-transparent
- **Filters**: practice, type (technical / soft / certification), category (e.g. Tool / platform), weight, hop depth.
- **Priority colour only appears in context.** With a role in focus, its requirements turn red (Critical), orange (Important) or green (Nice). With nothing in focus, everything stays neutral.
- **Never colour alone**:
  - priority also shows as line style (solid / dashed / dotted) and as the ring in the concentric layout
  - nodes carry a weight badge in their label
  - a legend is always visible
  - colours are chosen for colour-blind safety and ≥3:1 contrast against the background
- **Line width = strength** (1–5 mapped to 1–6px). Official paths are drawn as arrows between roles.
- **Side panel on click**:
  - description, type and (for roles) practice
  - connections grouped by kind
  - weight within the current focus
  - "Roles that need this", each with its weight
  - for a role: its specialisations and similar roles
  - links to the detail page and to compare
- **Path mode**: pick two roles, highlight the official path or the shortest route, dim everything else.
- **Accessibility**
  - The canvas has an accessible label and a live region that announces the selection.
  - The side panel's connection list is fully keyboard-driven and moves the graph focus.
  - Keys: `/` search, arrow keys walk neighbours, `Esc` clears focus.
  - A **Table view** tab shows the same data. Target is WCAG 2.2 AA.
- **Below 768px**: the table/list view is the default and the graph is opt-in. All other pages are responsive.

**How it performs (M8).** `/explore/perf` (not in production) draws a synthetic graph of 2,000 nodes and 20,000 links (`src/domain/testing/synthetic-graph.ts`). On a developer machine the overview is ready after about 1.7 s from the start of the page load, and panning and zooming with the mouse run at about 47 frames per second; `e2e/explore-performance.spec.ts` keeps both within budget (2 s and 25 fps; CI runs it with looser limits for its slower runners). What made it fast: a quick force layout (fcose "draft") for graphs over 250 nodes, steered only by the strongest 3,000 links; plain straight lines instead of curves; and, in big graphs, a cached image while panning and zooming (`textureOnViewport`). The **WebGL renderer** is available (`GraphCanvas webgl`) but not used: in headless Chromium without a GPU it was slower (6 frames per second) than the 2D canvas.

## 7. Seed data (`src/db/seed/`, fictional people only)

Seed v2 (M2) holds:

- one site, "Demo Site", with 5 practices
- 19 roles and 4 specialisations
- the catalogue: 102 technical skills (tools and platforms among them), 15 soft skills, 17 certifications
- 369 links: 245 requirements, 84 dependencies, 17 related pairs, 23 official paths
- 18 demo people, plus a Basic demo person (Sky Bennett, no profile), example recommendations and change requests

`src/db/seed/data.ts` is the source; `src/db/seed/seed.db.test.ts` guards it.

- **Practices and roles**:
  - **Frontend Practice**:
    - Frontend Developer, with specialisations **React** (React, Next.js) and **Angular** (Angular, RxJS)
    - UX Developer
    - Full-stack Developer
  - **Backend & Architecture**: Backend Developer, Solution Architect, Engineering Manager
  - **Data & AI**: Data Engineer, Analytics Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, AI Engineer
  - **Cloud & Security**: Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Security Engineer
  - **Delivery Management**: Business Analyst, Project Manager, Scrum Master, Product Owner, Delivery Manager
- **Scrum Master**:
  - **core**:
    - Critical: Scrum, Agile, Coaching, Communication, PSM I
    - Important: Facilitation, Stakeholder Management, Azure DevOps
    - Nice: Jira, Estimation, Change Management
  - **SAFe**: SAFe (Critical), PI Planning and SAFe Scrum Master (Important)
  - **Facilitation / Management 3.0**: Management 3.0 Practices and Facilitation (Critical; raised from Important in the core), Workshop Design and Management 3.0 Foundation (Important), Liberating Structures (Nice)

  Scrum Master, Project Manager and Product Owner share enough core requirements to be **similar roles**.

- **The scenario roles' requirements are fixed exactly** (tests fail if they change):
  - **Frontend Developer: React** (core + specialisation)
    - Critical: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML & CSS, Problem Solving, React
    - Important: Git, Agile, Accessibility, Testing
    - Nice: GitHub Copilot, Next.js, Figma Foundation
  - **Data Engineer**, **only**, and no certifications:
    - Critical: SQL, Python, Data Modelling, Problem Solving
    - Important: Spark, Databricks, Git
    - Nice: Agile
    - Prerequisites: Databricks builds on Python and Spark; Spark builds on Python and SQL.
  - **Project Manager**
    - Critical: Planning & Scheduling, Stakeholder Management, Risk Management, Communication
    - Important: Agile, Azure DevOps, Facilitation
    - Nice: Jira, Estimation, Change Management, PMP
    - No Leadership and no financial skills
  - **Delivery Manager**, no certifications:
    - Critical: Leadership, Financial Management, People Management, Stakeholder Management, Communication
    - Important: Account Management, Commercial Awareness, Risk Management
    - Nice: Agile
  - **Full-stack Developer**: Frontend core + React (C) + Node.js and REST APIs (I) + SQL (N).
- **Catalogue**:
  - Tools and platforms are technical skills with the category "Tool / platform" (their area is a tag).
  - Soft skills: Problem Solving, Solutioning, Product Thinking, Communication, Stakeholder Management, Facilitation, Negotiation, Leadership, Team Leading, People Management, Mentoring, Coaching, Change Management, Account Management, Commercial Awareness.
  - Certifications, each with an issuer: Figma Foundation, PSM I, PSPO I, SAFe Scrum Master, Management 3.0 Foundation, PMP, AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-204, AZ-305, PL-300, AI-102, DP-100, SC-200, Databricks Data Engineer Associate, CKA, Terraform Associate.
  - Certifications build on what they test, e.g. PSM I builds on Scrum.
- **Demo people** (`@example.com`), each profile pre-filled from the role's skill requirements and then adjusted:
  - **Site Lead**: Jordan Kim (Solution Architect).
  - **Practice Leads**: Taylor Brooks (Frontend), Robin Weiss (Backend & Architecture), Avery Chen (Data & AI), Jamie Ortiz (Cloud & Security), Casey Lin (Delivery Management).
  - **Morgan Lee** (Frontend Practice) manages:
    - Alex Rivera: Frontend Developer: React
    - Noah Fischer: Frontend Developer: Angular, without Testing
    - Mia Kowalski: UX Developer, with Figma Foundation
    - Leo Martins: Full-stack Developer
    - Zoe Adler: Frontend Developer: React, without Accessibility; target Full-stack Developer
  - **Riley Nowak** (Delivery Management) manages:
    - Sam Patel: Project Manager
    - Ella Jensen: Business Analyst; PL-300 **expired**
    - Omar Haddad: Scrum Master: SAFe; PSM I, and SAFe Scrum Master **expiring** in 35 days
    - Lena Hoffmann: Product Owner; PSPO I
    - Ben Carter: Scrum Master; PSM I; target Scrum Master: Facilitation / Management 3.0

  Frontend Practice and Delivery Management have 7 members each. The other practices are smaller than 5, so the Site Lead's aggregates show the hiding.

- **Examples**:
  - Recommendations: Morgan → Alex (target Full-stack, open), Morgan → Zoe (Accessibility, accepted), Riley → Ben (Management 3.0 specialisation, accepted), Riley → Sam (PMP, open).
  - Change requests:
    - add Playwright to Frontend Developer (open)
    - remove Accessibility (rejected, with a reason)
    - Jira on Scrum Master to Nice (approved)
    - a Kanban specialisation for Scrum Master (needs info, with a comment)
- **When it runs**: `pnpm db:seed` runs before every Vercel build, after the migrations, and only adds what's missing.
  - **Production:** it seeds the site, practices and graph once into an empty database, and never adds demo people, recommendations or change requests.
  - **Locally and on previews:** it runs in full.
  - Certification dates are relative to the day the seed runs.
- **Tests that guard the seed**:
  - organisation: site, practices, roles per practice, specialisations with scoped slugs
  - catalogue types and issuers; every example from the brief and the reviews
  - no unconnected items; link type rules; no `builds_on` cycles
  - the scenario roles' requirements; a specialisation raising a core weight
  - Scenarios 1 and 2 (role vs role and person vs role) as set operations on the data; `src/db/graph.db.test.ts` runs them end to end through the domain functions
  - leads, managers and their reports; pre-filled profiles; certification dates (valid, expiring, expired, no expiry)
  - recommendations and change requests in every state, with valid operations
  - idempotency; production mode without demo data

**M13: done.** Axe on every page for every kind of user, in both themes and at phone width, with menus and windows open (`e2e/a11y.spec.ts`, zero violations of any kind); the keyboard pass (`e2e/keyboard.spec.ts`); `pnpm smoke` for a deployed copy; the README's "Going live".

**M14: fixes.** Collected one by one with the owner, done in one go.

1. "My profile": the Appearance section goes to the bottom.
2. "My role" reads "I'm _role_ in _practice_ practice", with the role and the practice black and bold and the rest grey.
3. A **Permissions** page for the Site Lead (`/site/permissions`, in the Site menu): the four user types (Employee, Career Advisor, Practice Lead, Site Lead) and a table of what each may do, with ticked boxes. Read-only on purpose: the table is built from `can()` for a typical person of each type (`src/domain/permissions.ts`), so it can't disagree with the app. Making permissions editable would need them in the database, an audit trail and a `can()` that reads them; that is a milestone of its own.
4. The menu order is Me, Explore Skills (the old "Explore" group, renamed), Change requests, Team, Practice, Site: "Me" comes first and the change requests sit right under Explore Skills.
5. The sidebar groups have an icon each and are renamed: My Skills, Explore Skills, Manage Team, Lead Practice, Organize Site. "Change requests" is an item of Explore Skills, not a group of its own. The groups do not collapse: a title with its links under it (an accordion and a collapsible sidebar were tried and dropped).
6. Permissions page: the "Own profile" group comes first.
7. `/site/people` can filter to the career advisors (people with direct reports) and the Practice Leads.
8. "Manager" is renamed **Career Advisor** everywhere a person reads it (menus, pages, the Permissions table, audit lines, docs). The code keeps `manager` (`isManager`, `manager_id`, `reportCount`), so nothing in the database changes; old audit lines keep the old wording.
9. My profile: certifications are a third group under My skills, next to the technical and soft skills, with its own icon.
10. The product is called **Skill Navigator** (it was "Skill Graph"; the repository, package and URLs keep their names).
11. The demo sign-in offers six accounts, not eighteen: an Employee (Alex Rivera), a Career Advisor of two (Riley Nowak), a Practice Lead (Taylor Brooks), a Practice Lead who is the Career Advisor of one person (Casey Lin), the Site Lead (Jordan Kim), and a second Site Lead who is also a Practice Lead and a Career Advisor of two (Robin Weiss). To make the shapes exist, reporting lines moved (Omar and Lena report to Robin, Ben to Casey, so Riley has Sam and Ella). The other people stay in the seed. The sign-in also offers a seventh account, a Basic person (Sky Bennett).
12. The tests sign in through the sign-in endpoint (`e2e/helpers.ts`), because the picker no longer lists everyone; rate limiting is off wherever demo sign-in is on (never on production).
13. Production can be a demo: with `ENABLE_DEMO_SIGN_IN=true` (and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`) in the Vercel Production variables it offers the six demo accounts and seeds the demo people on every build, like a preview. It is off by default, and anyone who finds the address can then use the app as any demo person, so it is only for fictional data. Switch it off before real people use the site.

**M15: Basic user type and a default demo person.**

1. **Basic** is a user type that stands alone (`basic_users`, migration `0004`): the Site Lead sets and lifts it on `/site/people`, and the audit log records it. A Basic person gets the Explore Skills menu only; `/me`, `/me/plan`, `/onboarding` and every team, practice, request and site page are a 404, and `can()` denies their profile, plan and recommendation actions. It can't be set on a Site Lead, a Practice Lead or a Career Advisor, and none of those can be given to a Basic person (lift Basic first).
2. The Permissions page has a Basic column, built from `can()` like the others.
3. The demo sign-in offers a seventh account, Sky Bennett (Basic, no profile, no practice).
4. **Default demo person**: with `DEFAULT_DEMO_EMAIL` set (only where demo sign-in is on), a request without a session is sent through `/auto-sign-in`, which signs in as that person; the sign-in page does the same. `/sign-in?manual=1` still shows the picker, even when signed in. Signing out lands on `/sign-in`, so it signs you straight back in as the default person. The end-to-end tests blank the variable (`playwright.config.ts`), because they sign in as each person.

**M13-b: going live (needs the owner's Microsoft tenant and Vercel settings; Claude cannot do these).** Done when the last box is ticked.

- [ ] Entra: register the app (redirect URI `https://<production domain>/api/auth/callback/microsoft`), create a client secret; if the tenant blocks consent, IT grants admin consent once (README, "Sign-in").
- [ ] Vercel, Production only: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -base64 32`), `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`; redeploy.
- [ ] Sign in once with a Microsoft account, then insert the first Site Lead (SQL in README, "Going live"). From then on the Site Lead appoints leads and reporting lines in `/site`.
- [ ] `pnpm smoke https://skill-graph-one.vercel.app --production` passes (sign-in is Microsoft, not "switched off").
- [ ] By hand with a real account: onboarding, the Scenario 1 compare, a graph focus, one approved change request, and a Site Lead overview that names nobody.

Before any wider rollout (decisions for the owner, not blockers for M13-b): Vercel Hobby is non-commercial (Pro, or Azure App Service with the same Postgres); export and deletion of one's own data (GDPR) is not built; profile edits are not audited; some seed official-path notes look copied between roles.

## 9. Repo and agent workflow (feature branch → PR → auto-merge)

**Repo**

- `chrizspace/skill-graph`, public. The scaffold was the **only** commit made directly to `main`.

**`scripts/setup-repository.sh`** (idempotent `gh api` + `jq`):

- Repo settings: squash merge only; `allow_auto_merge`, `delete_branch_on_merge` and `allow_update_branch` on.
- **Ruleset on `main`**:
  - pull request required (0 approvals, because you can't approve your own PRs)
  - required status check `ci`, which must be up to date with `main`
  - no force pushes, no deletion, linear history
  - nobody can bypass it
- Secret scanning with push protection and Dependabot security updates turned on. Dependabot version updates run monthly, grouped (fewer PRs), and are **not** auto-merged.

**CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)**

- A public repo gets free GitHub-hosted runners, so minutes aren't a constraint. The full suite runs on every PR.
- Runs on `pull_request` and on pushes to `main`. A newer push to a PR cancels its running checks.
- Jobs:
  - `static`: format, lint, typecheck, unit tests
  - `db`: PGlite tests, plus a check that the migrations match the schema
  - `build`
  - `e2e` (from M4): a Postgres service container, migrate and seed, `next start`, Playwright in Chromium plus axe
  - `ci`: `needs: all`; this is the single required check
- Setup steps: pnpm from `packageManager`, Node from `.nvmrc` (24).

**Local checks**: `scripts/check.mts` runs only what the change touches; `--full` runs everything.

**Claude configuration (committed in the repo)**

- `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md` (keeps the Next 16 docs note). It adds the Git workflow, the definition of done, database rules, commands and an architecture map.
- `.claude/hooks/guard-main.mjs`, run as a PreToolUse hook on Bash. It **blocks**:
  - commits, merges and pushes on `main`
  - pushes that target `main`
  - `--force` / `--no-verify`
  - `gh pr merge --admin`
- `.claude/settings.json`: the hook, an allowlist (pnpm, git on feature branches, `gh pr …`, read-only docker) and a denylist (force pushes, pushes to `main`, admin merges, ruleset changes).
- `.claude/skills/feature/SKILL.md` (`/feature <slug>`) and `.claude/skills/ship/SKILL.md` (`/ship`): start a branch from an up-to-date `main`; check, push, open the PR, auto-merge, follow CI, clean up.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

**Manual setup by the repository owner** (accounts and secrets):

1. Vercel project and Neon integration, with preview branches: done.
2. Entra app registration for Microsoft sign-in, with its client ID and secret in Vercel's environment settings (M5; steps in the README). The README will list the steps.

## 10. Risks

- **Have / don't have is coarse**: a profile can't tell a beginner from an expert. That's a deliberate choice: the brief works with weights only. Evidence or endorsements could come later (V2).
- **Profile effort**: specialisations and certifications add work to the profile screens.
  - Mitigation: pre-fill from the role, one-tap ticking, and certification dates only where needed.
- **Privacy (GDPR)**: profiles are personal data.
  - Named profiles are visible only to the person, their manager and the Practice Leads of their practice.
  - The Site Lead sees aggregates only, with groups under 5 hidden.
  - Export and deletion of one's own data come before any real rollout.
- **Stale change requests**: a role can change while a request is open. Approval re-validates every operation and shows what no longer applies.
- **Org data quality**: home practices and reporting lines are entered by hand until the HR import (V2); wrong lines mean wrong visibility. The Site Lead's people screen shows people without a manager or practice.
- **Company sign-in**: the organisation's Entra tenant may block consent to an app registered outside it, which means its IT has to grant admin consent. Fallbacks: personal Microsoft accounts, or demo sign-in.
- **Vercel Hobby is non-commercial**: real rollout needs Pro, or Azure App Service with the same Postgres.
- **Full-graph performance at 20k links**: the UX defaults to focus mode, the WebGL renderer is available, and it gets measured in M7.
- **Seed realism vs exact scenarios**: the Data Engineer's requirement list is deliberately small, and that's documented in the seed.
- **Next 16 changes**: always read the bundled docs before using caching, routing or server action APIs.
- **Auto-merge is sequential**: the next feature branch starts from `main` after the previous PR lands. If CI gets slow, independent work can start on a stacked branch meanwhile.

## 11. How it gets verified

- **Every PR**:
  - `pnpm check` passes locally, then the `ci` check is green, then auto-merge
  - each UI change is checked in the built-in browser at 1280px and 375px
  - the Vercel preview URL loads with the demo sign-in
- **Scenarios** (unit tests for the logic, Playwright end-to-end for the UI):
  1. Frontend Developer: React → Data Engineer: shared and missing exactly as in the brief, in learning order.
  2. Project Manager → Delivery Manager: missing exactly as in the brief.
  3. A manager opens a report's profile: their fit to their role, official and suggested paths, reachable roles.
  4. A manager sends feedback on a role, the Practice Lead approves it, the role changes and the audit log links to the request. Reject, needs-info and a new-specialisation proposal (becomes a draft) work too.
  5. A Practice Lead edits a role in their practice and is refused for another practice's role.
  6. A manager recommends a target to a report, the report accepts it, and it becomes their target and plan.
  7. An expired certification isn't a gap: it counts as held, appears faded with its expiry date, and doesn't lower readiness. One expiring within 90 days is flagged.
  8. A Site Lead creates a practice and appoints its Practice Lead.
  9. The Scrum Master page shows its core, the SAFe and Management 3.0 specialisations (each with what it adds), and Project Manager and Product Owner as similar roles with their shared items.
  10. Privacy:
  - an employee can't open another person's profile
  - a Practice Lead sees only their practice's members
  - a Site Lead sees no names, and small groups are hidden
- **Performance**: a synthetic 2k/20k graph fixture with a measured overview load time and frame rate (M8).
- **Release (M13)**: production deploy on Vercel; `pnpm smoke <url> --production` (alive, no demo sign-in, Microsoft sign-in or switched off), then by hand with a real account: Microsoft sign-in, the Scenario 1 compare, a graph focus, one approved change request, and a Site Lead overview that names nobody.
- **Accessibility (M13)**: `e2e/a11y.spec.ts` runs axe over every page, theme and state and fails on any violation; `e2e/keyboard.spec.ts` is the keyboard pass.
