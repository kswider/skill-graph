/**
 * Seed data v2: fictional, company-neutral reference data (docs/PLAN.md §7).
 *
 * The requirements of Frontend Developer (core + React), Data Engineer, Full-stack Developer, Project Manager and
 * Delivery Manager are fixed by the brief's scenarios and guarded by src/db/seed/seed.db.test.ts:
 *   Scenario 1: Frontend Developer: React → Data Engineer shares Problem Solving, Git, Agile and misses SQL, Python,
 *               Data Modelling, Spark, Databricks. That's why Data Engineer's list is short and has no certifications.
 *   Scenario 2: Project Manager → Delivery Manager misses Financial Management, Account Management,
 *               Commercial Awareness, Leadership, People Management, and nothing else.
